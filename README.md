# CardioXplorer: An Open-Source Catheter Robot

This repository contains open-source resources for a modular robotic system, designed for catheter ablation procedures, and validated by trainees and cardiologists. However, the modular design of the robot encourages the application of the system in various fields requiring the use of catheters.

## Overview

The robot is designed to manipulate commercial catheters in 3 degrees of freedom (DoF):
- Axial insertion/retraction
- Tool shaft rotation
- Catheter tip articulation

Independent actuators were employed for each DoF to enable flexible reconfiguration. The handle interface is easily customizable using silicone molds, thus able to accommodate various commercial catheters.

## Content

The repository contains:
- **CAD models** - 3D design files for mechanical parts.
- **Catheter Library** - 3D design files for 3 commercial catheter handles for ablation therapy and corresponding design files to develop silicone inserts for knob-based actuation module.
- **Software** - Control code, simulation (Blender Python API), data logger.
- **Media** - Photos and diagrams of the robot and the electronics.
- **Clincal Feedback** - Questionnaire and feedback results.
